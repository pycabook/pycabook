Alien, 1979

I will track here changes between releases of the book, following [link]("https://semver.org/", "Semantic Versioning"). A change in the *major* number means an incompatible change, that is a big rewrite of the book, also known as 2nd edition, 3rd edition, and so on. A change in the *minor* number means that something important was added to the content, like a new section or chapter. A change in the *patch* number signals minor fixes like typos in the text or the code, rewording of sentences, and so on.

*Current version*: 2.1.3

=== Version 2.1.3 (2023-05-XX)

* This version has been ported to Mau version 3, which at the time of writing is still in development but will be published soon.
* [link]("https://github.com/isparks", "Ian Sparks") spotted a typo that prevented a foot note from being rendered in chapter 7. Thank Ian!
* GitHub users [link]("https://github.com/Robert-at-GE", "Robert-at-GE") and [link]("https://github.com/halbow", "halbow") noticed that line numbers have been introduced in code snippets while the section "Typographic conventions" still mentioned there are no numbers. I fixed it now, thanks both!
* [link]("https://github.com/ar-qun", "Alex") noticed a typo in chapter 2. This was fixed a while ago but I forgot to mention the contribution. Thanks Alex!
* [link]("https://github.com/rabbl", "Ralf Junghanns") found a bug in the code of `tests/repository/postgres/conftest.py` where `connection.close()` was just mentioned and not called. I fixed that in the [link]("https://github.com/pycabook/rentomatic", "code repository") and in the book. Thanks Ralf!
* The title of chapter 2 was incorrectly repeated and had been fixed now.

=== Version 2.1.2 (2022-01-06)

* Chapter 8 has been improved with migrations that correctly create the tables in the production database.
* [link]("https://github.com/ivanovmg", "Maxim Ivanov") corrected many bugs both in the book and in the code repository, and fixed several inconsistencies between the two. An impressive job, thank you so much for your help!
* GitHub user [link]("https://github.com/robveijk", "robveijk") spotted a mention to a file that is not included in the second edition. Thanks!
* GitHub user [link]("https://github.com/mathisheeren", "mathisheeren") corrected a typo. Thank you!
* GitHub user [link]("https://github.com/4myhw", "4myhw") found a broken link and fixed the wrong use of `self` instead of `cls` in the code. Thanks!
* Several people, in particular [link]("https://github.com/JakWai01", "Jakob Waibel") spotted a typo in the name of Robert Martin. Thanks to all, and apologies to Mr. Martin.
* GitHub user [link]("https://github.com/1110sillabo", "1110sillabo") pointed out the PDF creation wasn't perfect with the toolchain based on AsciiDoctor, which was fixed going back to Lanpub's Markua.

=== Version 1.0.11 (2020-02-15)

* GitHub user [link]("https://github.com/lrfuentesw", "lrfuentesw") spotted an error in the memory repository. Price filters with a string value were not working because they were not converted into integers. Thank you!
