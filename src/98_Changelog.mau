What's the last thing you do remember? Hmm?

I will track here changes between releases of the book, following [link]("https://semver.org/", "Semantic Versioning"). A change in the *major* number means an incompatible change, that is a big rewrite of the book, also known as 2nd edition, 3rd edition, and so on. A change in the *minor* number means that something important was added to the content, like a new section or chapter. A change in the *patch* number signals minor fixes like typos in the text or the code, rewording of sentences, and so on.

*Current version*: 2.1.1
