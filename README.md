# Clean Architectures in Python

This is the repository with the source code of the book "Clean Architectures in Python".
This is the **second edition** and the current full version is 2.0.0

If for some reason you need to read the first edition you can find it using the branch `first-edition`.

## Editions

My recommendation is to read the book online at TODO. The HTML version is beautifully formatted thanks to [Asciidoctor](https://asciidoctor.org/), and you can easily copy and paste code. If you prefer a printable version you can download the PDF version from [Leanpub](https://leanpub.com/clean-architectures-in-python).
